Year 3 semester 2 
course project: Big Data Analytics

1. Find a paper in data mining conferences from 2019 to 2024.
2. Read and analyze the paper, including the research problem, proposed framework, datasets, and experimental settings.
3. Reproduce the deep learning framework proposed in the paper, by using the codes and dataset released by the authors (please select a paper that has released its codes and datasets).
4. Apply two traditional machine learning algorithms, such as SVM and random forest, to the same research problem and dataset in the paper. There are many machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn. You can implement them by a few lines. You should use k-fold cross-validation, unless the training set and test set are fixed, i.e., the split is provided by the paper.
5. Apply one basic neural network, such as multi-layer perceptron, CNNs, and RNNs to the same dataset. Summarize the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms, the basic neural network, and the proposed framework, in a table.
6. Implement more complicated neural network architectures by using PyTorch. Design and implement a new neural network architecture, and apply it to the same dataset. It cannot be simple models (e.g., traditional machine learning algorithms, multilayer perceptron, CNNs, RNNs) or the frameworks proposed by the paper.
7. Summarize your contributions, observations, and conclusions as a report with at least five pages.
